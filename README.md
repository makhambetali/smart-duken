The real goal of the project is to make it easier for my parents, who have a fairly large grocery store and spend a lot of their time working with papers and reports

This project involves the automation of routine tasks performed in small businesses (shop, pharmacy, etc.). The system includes the management of suppliers of goods and their supplies. Namely, you can track when they arrive, how much money you need to pay them, whether there is additional important information like a bonus, an exchange, etc. and also plan deliveries for a certain day. As soon as the shipments arrive, you can confirm their arrival and save the receipts with invoices in the database, which completely eliminates the need to constantly search among the stacks of papers. 
In addition, it is possible to manage customer debts, add, delete and see detailed information such as time and comments on the debt, which reduces the risk of conflicts and misunderstandings.


Also included functions that are responsible for all calculations of the amount of deliveries and even provide information on how the payment was made (cash or bank settlement).
In addition, there is a separate page for viewing the history of deliveries and to see detailed information about the delivery that was days, weeks or even months ago.
You can also track the contributions and losses that were made with the cash register and these data can also be viewed in the future.


Since it is planned to further develop this project and implement it in small businesses, it was decided to use a powerful and secure framework - Django. There are also asynchronous programming elements to improve user experience.
